# OpenWRT statistics for Home Assistant

Bridge the gap between OpenWRT and Home Assistant: collect statistics from your Router using these template sensors.

These sensors won't replace a proper integration for OpenWRT, which is currently not in a good state. The goal is to get some (basic) information from OpenWRT in Home Assistant so you can monitor it.

This collection of sensors will expose the following information:

- CPU Temperature in Â°C
- Connected clients (number of) to 2.4 and 5ghz Access Points
- DHCP active leases (number of)
- Network connections (number of)
- Ping to Google
- RAM statistics (Buffered, Cached, Free, Used)
- System Load (L1, L5, L15)
- Uptime (days, weeks, months)
- LAN Packets: processed/s, dropped and errors
- LAN Received and Transferred MB/s
- WAN Status: Connected/Disconnected
- WAN IP address
- Wireguard Packets: processed/s, dropped and errors
- Wireguard Received and Transferred MB/s

Wireguard and LAN are just examples: you can track any interface you'd like.

# Setup
### Home Assistant MQTT setup
Let's prepare Home Assistant first.

If you don't have it yet, get Mosquitto Broker up and running. Read ![the official docs](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/174f8e66d0eaa26f01f528beacbde0bd111b711c/mosquitto/DOCS.md) to get started. Don't forget to configure the MQTT Integration as well!

### OpenWRT
### Collecd and MQTT Setup

Install the following packages:

    luci-app-statistics 
    collectd-mod-mqtt
    mosquitto-client-ssl

The first package will install `collectd` and most of the essential dependencies.

Optional `collectd-mod-*` packages can provide more data. These are recommended:

    collectd-mod-thermal
    collectd-mod-uptime
    collectd-mod-dhcpleases
    collectd-mod-ping

Navigate to *Statistics > Setup*. If you installed optional mod packages, enable them in the *General Plugin* tab.

If you're running OpenWRT snapshots from the master branch (24.x and above), the luci-app-statistics [has the ability](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/commit/8bf5646459e229c1d01736f7c45f3b1c9bf3058f) to configure MQTT via GUI. If you're running a version up to OpenWRT 23.05, you'll have to follow the CLI steps. The next major release will have this built in.
<details>
     <summary>GUI configuration - OpenWRT snapshots</summary>
    
In the *Output Plugins* Tab, enable *Mqtt* and click on Configure. Then click Add, and enter the following Details:
- Name - `OpenWRT` or what you like
- Host - this is your Home Assistant IP
- Port - `1883` if you're using the default port
- User - your MQTT User
- Password - your MQTT password
- Prefix - `collectd`

Save and apply changes.  

</details>


<details>
     <summary>CLI configuration - up to OpenWRT 23.05</summary>
Connect to your OpenWRT router via SSH, create a new folder called `conf.d` in `/etc/collectd/`

Using your favourite editor, create a new file in conf.d called `mqtt.conf`

Add this configuration to the file, and edit the lines:
* `Host` replace this with your Home Assistant IP
* `User` replace this with your MQTT User
* `Password` replace this with your MQTT password
   
```shell
LoadPlugin mqtt
<Plugin "mqtt">
  <Publish "OpenWRT">
    Host "192.168.1.101"
    Port "1883"
    User "mqtt_openwrt"
    Password "MySuperSafePW2!@"
    ClientId "OpenWRT"
    Prefix "collectd"
    Retain true
  </Publish>
</Plugin>
```

Restart collectd on OpenWRT by executing `service collectd restart`.
</details>

OpenWRT will start sending data to Home Assistant, but you won't be able to see it (yet).

### WAN Status and IP address

For some weird reason, the WAN connectivity status and IP address are not collected by any collectd plugins, so we have to use a hotplug script.  
- Download the script `01-ha-mqtt-wan-status`
- Edit the user variables using the data you have already entered for the previous setup
- Connect the OpenWRT router via SSH and place this script in `/etc/hotplug.d/iface/`
- Make the script executable `chmod +x 01-ha-mqtt-wan-status`

The script is now ready but won't trigger until a connectivity event.
To test the script, you can disconnect and reconnect the wan using this command `ifdown wan && ifup wan`.

**Please note**: this script has some hardcoded values. 
- WAN Status won't work if your wan interface is not called `wan`
- WAN IP address won't work if the wan device name is not `pppoe-wan`

### Home Assistant Entities setup

Go back to Home Assistant for the final setup.
Some text replacements are required, on Windows you can use Notepad++.

Open this sample [configuration.yaml](configuration.yaml).

Replace occurrencies of `<Open-WRT-Hostname>` with the value you see in *OpenWRT > System > System > General Settings > Hostname*

Each sensor has a section like the following:

```yaml
    device:
            identifiers: WRT7800
            name: Router Netgear R7800
            model: R7800
            manufacturer: Netgear
```

It allows to create a MQTT device, so all entities are grouped nicely. Replace these example values for **each sensor** entering what you like, these are just informational labels. Use the same values for each entity!

When you are done with text editing, paste the code in your configuration.yaml on Home Assistant.

Save the file and restart Home Assistant.

When finished, you will have a new MQTT device named after the name you have chosen above, and the entities will be populated.

Please note that some entities require additional OpenWRT mod packages.

## Dashboard and card setup

To use this card, you must install `multiple-entity-row` and `mini-graph-card` from HACS.

Edit the dashboard, add a new YAML card and paste the code you find in [lovelace.yaml](lovelace.yaml).

## Troubleshooting

To quickly check that you're receiving data from your OpenWRT router, open HA and Navigate to the MQTT Integration, then click *Configure*. In the section Listen to a topic, add `collectd/#`, then click *Start Listening*. You should see many messages coming from OpenWRT.

Check received data on MQTT server using  [MQTT Explorer](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/addon-mqtt-explorer-new-version/603739)  or use this code if you prefer:

    mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -u user -P Password -t collectd/# -d
